# APCS Tutoring Homework

## Process
* Every week after our 1-on-1 session, I will upload a new homework file.
You have until the beginning of our next session to do the assignment and upload onto Github.
* If anything is unclear in the assignment, please contact me via Google Classroom.
* For any questions you don't know how to do, try to write down in a comment what your thought process is, even if you think you're wrong. We can go over the problem next session.
